Put here your GUI code here created with your favorite front-end technologies. The backend is configured to look for
frontend code in the `gui` directory of the root directory. So the code put here shall be configured to produce output
to the `gui` directory (e.g. using webpack, gulp or equivalent). Or forget all this and just put your frontend code
directly in the `gui` directory.
